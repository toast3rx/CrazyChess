# CrazyChess

## Description 
CrazyChess is a chess bot created as a college project by a team of 4 friends. 
CrazyHouse is a modified version of the traditional chess game in which a player can place captured pieces back onto the game board.

## Build
 Simply run `make run` to build the app in the root folder. You can use `make clean` command to remove all the files 
 created from building the bot.

## Usage

You can use it using `xboard` app:
* in terminal use the following command: `xboar -fcp "make run" -scp 'second_bot'`
* fcp specifies the first chess bot and scp the second;
  * if you want to play against the bot or put the bot play agains itself, `scp` can be omitted.

What helped us the most was the [Chess Programming Wiki](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page) which we adapted to
the rules of CrazyHouse.
